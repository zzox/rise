A challenging vertical-scrolling combat-platformer.  Made using Phaser 3 for the Github Game Off Game jam on itch.io.  Inspired by Celeste and Towerfall, as well as games with vertical scrolling levels like Rayman.  All animations, music, sound effects made by zzox.  All code is convered under the MIT license, while all assests are covered under the CC
