A challenging vertical-scrolling combat-platformer.  Made using Phaser 3 for the [itch.io Game Off]().  Inspired by [Celeste]() and [Towerfall](), as well as games with vertical scrolling levels like [Rayman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayman_(video_game)). All music, sound effects, sprites, animations and game programming were created by zzox (tyler). The backgrounds were created by images in the public domain converted with Pixelator. All code is convered under the MIT license, while all assests are covered under the CC-BY-Attribution license.
